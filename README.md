Clone of Terry Cavanagh's "Super Hexagon" in HTML5

## Description
Clone of Terry Cavanagh's game [Super Hexagon](http://superhexagon.com/) made entirely with CSS3 transforms and animations.

Currently it's only compatible with webkit browsers (using -webkit- prefix for CSS3 features). Running it on fullscreen with large screen resolutions may cause some flickering.

### How it works

- //TO-DO

### Possible future improvements (contribute!):

* Create levels dinamically
* Make it responsive
* Use LESS to generate rules for animations easily (and adding all vendor prefixes)
* Increase difficulty in-game programatically
* Music?

## Changelog
* 0.1.: Initial version
